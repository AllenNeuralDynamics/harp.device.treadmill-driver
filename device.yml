registers:
  Encoder:
    address: 32
    type: S32
    access: Read
    description: Contains the current accumulated number of ticks.
  Torque:
    address: 33
    type: S16
    access: Read
    description: Contains the current torque value.
  TorqueLoadCurrent:
    address: 34
    type: S16
    access: Read
    description: Contains the current output current applied to the variable torque load.
  SensorData:
    address: 35
    type: S32
    length: 3
    access: Event
    description: Emits a periodic event containing the packaged treadmill data. [Encoder, Torque, TorqueLoadCurrent]
    payloadSpec:
      Encoder:
        offset: 0
      Torque:
        offset: 1
      TorqueLoadCurrent:
        offset: 2
  SensorDataDispatchRate:
    address: 36
    type: U16
    access: Write
    maxValue: 1000
    minValue: 0
    description: Value greater than 0 will enable the periodic dispatch of treadmill data events at the specified rate (sp/s).
  BrakeCurrentSetPoint:
    address: 37
    type: U16
    access: Write
    maxValue: 65535
    minValue: 0
    description: Sets the raw value of the torque set-point to be applied to the treadmill. This value is cleared to 0 if torque_limiting is enabled and triggered. Further writes in this condition return a WRITE_ERROR.
  TareSensors:
    address: 38
    type: U8
    access: Write
    description: Tares the specified sensors.
    maskType: Sensors
  ResetTareSensors:
    address: 39
    type: U8
    access: Write
    description: Removes the tare from the specified sensors.
    maskType: Sensors
  EnableTorqueLimit:
    address: 40
    type: U8
    access: Write
    description: Enables(1)/Disables(0) the brake if the maximum torque sensor value is detected. This register will be enabled by default.
    maskType: EnableFlag
  TorqueLimitState:
    address: 41
    type: U8
    access: [Event, Write]
    description: A value greater than 1 indicates that the torque limit has been triggered and the brake setpoint will be cleared. Writing a value of 0 will clear the torque limit state and re-enable the brake.
